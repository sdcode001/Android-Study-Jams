## Easy Bill Book


### Problem Statement:
In our daily life we see our local shops and university/college canteens maintain notebook to write customers bills/dues but sometimes its very difficult to find old bills    and keep all the past records. In this system sometimes customers are also get confused about their dues and then its become very problematic for both customer and shop        owner.Another problem is all shops dont have their own website where they can show all the products/food items avablible and price list to their customers.So here we can solve all the problems mentioned above using a mobile application which is very user friendly and effective.
    
### Proposed Solution :
This "Easy Bill Book" app can maintain all customers bills/payment/dues in database. user(shop owner) can easily register all customers with their names and phone numbers   and at the same time a notification SMS will sent to that customer.after registering customer shop owner can update their bill/due records when new payment is done and at the same time a notification SMS will sent to that customer on his/her registered phone number from shop owners phone mentioning shop name and in this way both customer and shop owner stay updated.if shop owner wants to remove a customes form list,he/she can easily do it using delete button and customer record gets deleted from database.Records of all the customers will show on the home page in listed row format.There is a option where shop owner can set his/her shop name on the app and also this will mentioned in all the SMS notifications.In addition there is a bell button
